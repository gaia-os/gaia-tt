    "# InFact: Building Trust in Science through Collaborative Evaluation\n",
    "*A Gaia Lab project*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> What we should do is create an institution that collects and evaluates scientific evidence and gives out confidence values based on evidence. -- [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucXnn64qtk&t=314s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The InFact Project is our attempt to realize this vision. We're building a prototype for a decentralized system that evaluates scientific claims and provides a clear measure of confidence based on available evidence.  Imagine a collaborative platform where scientists and the public can work together to assess the reliability of scientific findings, supported by AI and rigorous automated statistics. This is the core idea behind InFact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does InFact work?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, InFact uses a network of interconnected nodes. Each node focuses on a specific scientific question, like \"Do human-generated greenhouse gas emissions significantly increase global temperatures?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each node, a sophisticated \"inference engine\" analyzes data related to the question. This engine combines the power of artificial intelligence (specifically, large language models or LLMs) with Bayesian statistics, a mathematical framework for updating beliefs based on evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data collection:  The node gathers data from various sources (research papers, datasets, etc.) related to the scientific question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI-powered analysis:  LLMs are used to automatically extract key information from the data, identify relevant studies, and even assess the quality of the evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bayesian updating:  The system uses Bayesian methods to weigh the evidence and update a \"confidence score\" for the scientific claim. This score reflects the strength of the evidence supporting the claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transparency and traceability:  All data, analyses, and confidence scores are recorded and made available for scrutiny. This ensures transparency and allows for continuous improvement of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addressing the Challenges of Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges in evaluating scientific claims is the sheer diversity and complexity of scientific data. InFact tackles this challenge by using LLMs to generate custom data analysis pipelines for each new piece of evidence. We use frontier off-the-shelf LLMs (currently, Claude 3.5 Sonnet). These AI models are pre-trained on vast amounts of scientific literature, allowing them to adapt to different types of studies and data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beyond the Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "While our current prototype relies heavily on LLMs, we recognize the need for even greater rigor. Our team is developing a framework for \"automatic progressive data analysis.\" This framework will combine the flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of established statistical models, creating a more robust and trustworthy system for evaluating scientific claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "## InFact in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "We envision InFact as a user-friendly platform that presents complex scientific information in a clear and accessible way. Imagine interactive visualizations that show how confidence scores evolve as new evidence emerges, along with explanations that help users understand the reasoning behind the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Future of Scientific Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "InFact is more than just a technology; it's a vision for a future where scientific knowledge is more accessible, transparent, and trustworthy. By empowering scientists and the public to collaboratively evaluate evidence, we can foster a deeper understanding of science and its role in shaping our world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Gaia Network\n",
    "\n",
    "InFact is also envisioned as a demonstration of the capabilities of the [Gaia Network Protocol](https://gaia-lab.de), the Gaia Lab's main project. Visit our website to learn more.\n",

    "# Technical description (assumes math/stats background, feel free to skip otherwise)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we propose **InFact**: a prototype implementation for such a scientific institution, specifically as a decentralized model-based inference engine combining generative AI and Bayesian statistics. InFact is also an implementation of a subset of the [Gaia Network Protocol](https://engineeringideas.substack.com/p/gaia-network-an-illustrated-primer).\n",
    "\n",
    "An InFact node consists of:\n",
    "* A natural-language description of a hypothesis $H$, a binary statement that represents the scope of this node -- i.e., the scientific question the node is supposed to provide confidence values for. Our standing example here will be: \"Human-generated GHG emissions significantly increase global temperatures.\"\n",
    "* A *model* composed of:\n",
    "  * A *likelihood function* that receives a data point $D_i$ and calculates the positive and negative log-likelihoods $l^+_i = \\log P(D_i\\ |\\ H, D_{<i}), l^-_i = \\log P(D_i\\ |\\ \\neg H, D_{<i})$. These are simply the (log) probabilities of such data being observed assuming that $H$ is true and false, respectively.\n",
    "  * A *posterior log-odds ratio* or belief state $\\pi_i = \\log \\frac{P(H\\ |\\ D_1 \\dots D_i)}{P(\\neg H\\ |\\ D_1 \\dots D_i)}$, which is updated by the likelihood function. Before observing any data points, this starts as a *prior log-odds ratio* $\\pi_0$; then after the likelihood function runs, the posterior gets updated as $\\pi_i = \\pi_{i-1} + l^+_i - l^-_i$.\n",
    "  * A set of *hyperparameters* to calculate confidence intervals around the posterior. These can simply be Beta distribution parameters $\\alpha^{+}_i , \\alpha^{-}_i$, updated as $\\alpha^{+}_i = \\alpha^{+}_{i-1} + P(H\\ |\\ D_1 \\dots D_i), \\alpha^{-}_i = \\alpha^{-}_{i-1} + P(\\neg H\\ |\\ D_1 \\dots D_i)$. Assuming that $H$ has a true truth value $p^*$, then this second-order distribution converges to a Delta peaked at $p^*$.\n",
    "* A simple database that stores the sequence of tuples $\\{(D_i, l^+_i, l^-_i, \\pi_i)\\}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end we also show a UX for displaying the evolution of $\\pi_i$ and its interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge here is the model, specifically the likelihood function. Data comes in an immense variety of shapes and sizes; it is often imprecise and noisy. We also often don't have first-hand access to data, only to second-hand reports and summaries. It is impossible to define a likelihood upfront that will adequately and perfectly extract and incorporate all this information into the $l^{+,-}_i$ updates -- which would be equivalent to having a universal data analysis workflow. Instead, we use pre-trained LLMs to perform a plausible approximation of this workflow, effectively generating a custom data analysis pipeline that is updated every time the data set is added to. Contemporary LLMs have sufficient built-in knowledge of science and statistics to perform decently at this task. Furthermore, the LLM prompt and response are recorded, producing a complete rationale which can be inspected and improved upon. (This is sufficient for a prototype, but we can and should aspire for better rigor. Our team is developing a framework for automatic progressive data analysis -- which uses LLMs to propose workflow components, but then crystallizes known-good components into a database of reusable and vetted models, rather than naively relying on LLMs for ab initio analysis every time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the algorithm we implement:\n",
    "* Receive a data file (ex: a PDF, HTML, CSV, or PNG).\n",
    "* [LLM] Parse the file into a set of data points.\n",
    "* [LLM] Identify which data points are redundant (have been previously observed) and can be safely discarded.\n",
    "* [LLM] Generate a likelihood model for the remaining data points, incorporating all metadata available from the file, as well as background knowledge that the modeler has. Relevant questions: Is this is a meta-analysis or an observational study? Are uncertainties reported, or can they be calculated? How trustworthy is the source?\n",
    "* Run the likelihood model and compute the log-likelihood updates.\n",
    "* Compute the new posterior and Beta hyperparameters.\n",
    "* Store updates in the database.\n",
    "* Render the UX."
